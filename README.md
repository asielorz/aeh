This project aims to be a library where I collect all the utility code that I end up writing for different projects so that I can more easily reuse it. It will mainly contain string and file functions, mathematical functions, some containers and algorithms, monadic error handling mechanisms and other utilities.

The name stands for my own name, Asier Elorz Hern√°ez.

This library is mainly for personal use. I do not promise anything regarding documentation, bugs, platform portability or supported features. If you are thinking of using it, consider using other better mantained libraries instead.
