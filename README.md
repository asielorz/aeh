This project aims to be a library where I collect all the utility code that I end up writing for different projects so that I can more easily reuse it. It will mainly contain string and file functions, mathematical functions, some containers and algorithms, monadic error handling mechanisms and other utilities.

The name stands for my own name, Asier Elorz Hern√°ez.

The current status of the project is not usable. It is a repo just because I need to work on it from different locations. I aim to add wider testing coverage, conan package support and opting in and out of dependencies.
